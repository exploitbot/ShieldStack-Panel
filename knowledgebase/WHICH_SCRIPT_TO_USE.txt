QUICK DECISION GUIDE:
=====================

"I just want all the images with good filenames so I can
 organize them myself later"
   → Use: download_all_images.py ⭐

"I want an Excel file with the images already embedded"
   → Use: download_images_windows.py

"I'm running this on a Linux server automatically"
   → Use: download_images_auto.py


HOW TO RUN (Windows):
=====================

1. Copy the entire 'grabimages' folder to your Windows PC

2. Open Command Prompt

3. Navigate to the folder:
   cd C:\path\to\grabimages

4. Run your chosen script:
   python download_all_images.py
   OR
   python download_images_windows.py

5. Enter credentials when prompted:

ALL SCRIPTS REQUIRE:

✓ Python 3
✓ pip install requests urllib3
✓ Network access to https://helpdesk.appsforte.com
✓ Valid ManageEngine credentials

For Option 2 & 3, also need:
✓ pip install openpyxl Pillow


RECOMMENDATION:
===============

Based on your request to "grab all images and name them appropriately
to organize manually later", I recommend:

   👉 download_all_images.py 👈

This gives you:
  - All images with descriptive names
  - Solution ID in filename
  - Solution title in filename
  - Image numbers (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.)
  - Detailed index showing which images belong to which solutions
  - Full control to organize however you want


EXAMPLE OUTPUT (download_all_images.py):
