How to Download and Embed Images into Excel
=============================================

I've created an automated script that will:
1. Log into the ManageEngine web interface
2. Download all 420 embedded images
3. Create a new Excel file with images embedded

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
✓ Python 3 with requests, openpyxl, and Pillow (already installed)
✓ ManageEngine login credentials
✓ Access to https://helpdesk.appsforte.com/

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
1. Open a terminal

2. Run the script:
   python3 /tmp/download_and_embed_images.py

3. When prompted, enter your ManageEngine credentials:
   - Username: (your helpdesk username)
   - Password: (your helpdesk password)

4. The script will:
   - Test authentication
   - Download all images (this may take 10-20 minutes for 420 images)
   - Create Excel file with embedded images
   - Save to: /home/appsforte/ManageEngine_KB_WITH_EMBEDDED_IMAGES.xlsx

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------
- Downloads images from URLs like:
  https://helpdesk.appsforte.com/api/v3/solutions/660/images/69773

- Saves images locally to:
  /home/appsforte/solution_images_downloaded/

- Embeds the first image from each solution into Excel
  (resized to fit: max 200x150 pixels)

- Creates a comprehensive spreadsheet with:
  * Solution ID
  * Title
  * Description (plain text, limited to 500 chars)
  * Embedded image (actual picture in cell)
  * Attachments list

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If images don't download:
1. Check that https://helpdesk.appsforte.com/ is accessible
2. Verify your credentials are correct
3. The API endpoint might require special authentication

Alternative: Manual download
If the automated script doesn't work, the ManageEngine web interface
must be accessed manually through a web browser.

NOTES:
------
- The script includes a 0.5 second delay between downloads to be polite
- Images are resized to fit in Excel cells (max 200x150px)
- Only the first image per solution is embedded (to keep file size manageable)
- All images are saved locally for reference

ESTIMATED TIME:
---------------
- 420 images × 0.5 seconds = ~3-4 minutes minimum
- Plus download time depending on image sizes
- Total: 10-20 minutes expected
