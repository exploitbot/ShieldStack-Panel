ManageEngine Embedded Images - Extraction Notes
================================================

SUMMARY:
--------
Found 420 embedded images across the solutions, but the actual image binary
data could not be extracted from the database.

IMAGE LOCATIONS IN DATABASE:
----------------------------
The images are referenced via API paths like:
  /api/v3/solutions/660/images/69773

Where:
  - 660 = Solution ID
  - 69773 = Image ID

INVESTIGATION RESULTS:
----------------------
✗ Images NOT in: sdeskattachment table
✗ Images NOT in: fileAttachments/Solutions directory (deleted/missing)
✗ Images NOT in: contentstore table (doesn't exist)
✗ Images NOT stored as BLOB/bytea in any obvious table

POSSIBLE STORAGE LOCATIONS:
----------------------------
The images are likely stored in one of these ways:

1. **Embedded in Description HTML** (Base64):
   Some images might be embedded directly as base64 in the HTML.
   Check the solution.description column for src="data:image..." patterns.

2. **Separate Content Management System**:
   ManageEngine may use a separate CMS or file store not in PostgreSQL.

3. **File System** (Different Location):
   Images might be in: C:\\Program Files\\ManageEngine\\ServiceDesk\\webapps\\
   or another directory we haven't checked.

4. **External Storage**:
   Could be on S3, Azure Blob Storage, or similar.

HOW TO ACCESS THE IMAGES:
--------------------------
The images ARE accessible through the ManageEngine web interface at:
  https://helpdesk.appsforte.com/

To view/extract images:
1. Log into ManageEngine ServiceDesk
2. Navigate to the specific solution (e.g., Solution #660)
3. View the solution in the web interface
4. Right-click on images and save them individually
5. Or use browser developer tools to extract image URLs

AUTOMATED EXTRACTION OPTIONS:
------------------------------
To extract all images programmatically:

Option 1 - Web Scraping:
  Use a tool like Selenium/Playwright to log into ManageEngine,
  visit each solution page, and download images.

Option 2 - API Authentication:
  If you have API credentials, use the REST API with proper authentication:
  GET https://helpdesk.appsforte.com/api/v3/solutions/{id}/images/{imageid}

Option 3 - Database Deep Dive:
  Have a DBA examine all tables with "oid" or "lo" (large object) types,
  or check for tables we haven't explored yet.

WHAT'S IN THE SPREADSHEET:
---------------------------
The Excel file includes:
- All 647 solutions with descriptions
- Markers showing where each image appears: [IMAGE #1 - ID: 69773]
- Count of images per solution in "Embedded Images" column
- All image IDs documented

This allows you to:
- See which solutions have images
- Know exactly how many images each solution contains
- Have the image IDs to look them up in ManageEngine

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
For a complete knowledge base with images, the best approach is:
1. Use the Excel spreadsheet as the text reference
2. Keep the ManageEngine system running for image access
3. OR extract images manually/via web scraping for critical solutions

Contact the ManageEngine vendor or check their documentation about
where embedded solution images are stored in their architecture.
