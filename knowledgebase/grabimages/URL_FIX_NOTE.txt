URL Correction Applied - October 29, 2025
=========================================

ISSUE:
------
Scripts were originally configured with incorrect domain:
  ✗ https://helpdesk.appshosting.com (WRONG)

FIXED TO:
---------
  ✓ https://helpdesk.appsforte.com (CORRECT)

FILES UPDATED:
--------------
Python Scripts:
  ✓ download_all_images.py
  ✓ download_images_windows.py
  ✓ download_images_auto.py
  ✓ download_and_embed_images.py

Documentation:
  ✓ WHICH_SCRIPT_TO_USE.txt
  ✓ DOWNLOAD_ALL_IMAGES_README.txt
  ✓ HOW_TO_DOWNLOAD_IMAGES.txt
  ✓ IMAGE_EXTRACTION_NOTES.txt

VERIFIED:
---------
All references to the ManageEngine helpdesk now point to the correct domain:
helpdesk.appsforte.com

The scripts should now connect successfully to your ManageEngine instance.

This note can be deleted - it's just for reference.
